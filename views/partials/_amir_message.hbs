                        So colorful, historic, eventful, memorable graduation ceremony!<br>
                        It was so humbling an experience to be able to lead the ceremony accompanied by my two
                        predecessors, Dr Kaba Urgessa and Prof. Fikre Lemessa, both of whom have already had their
                        visible footprints in the course of the development of the university to its current
                        stature.<br>
                        It was such a unique occasion that brings three presidents together in one graduation ceremony.
                        I also hope that our students who graduated today had the same feeling and considered how lucky
                        and blessed they were to witness such a rare experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And I hope you agree with me that this was not the only reason that made todayâ€™s graduation
                        unique: the number of PhDs, which is the largest in recent years, three of which were first time
                        (reproductive health, water resources engineering, and climate change adaptation and
                        mitigation), not to mention the first of its kind sub-specialty program in gastrointestinal
                        cancer surgery, the 30 Somaliland graduates from our Hargeysa campus, and the twin brothers
                        (Bona and Bonsa) who became the third in JU history to have graduated from just one program, the
                        medical faculty (in MD).
