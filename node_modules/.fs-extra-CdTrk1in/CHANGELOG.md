9.0.0 / 2020-03-19
------------------

### Breaking changes

- Requires Node.js version 10 or greater ([#725](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/725), [#751](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/751))
- Switched `ensureDir*` to use a fork of https://github.com/sindresorhus/make-dir to make use of native recursive `fs.mkdir` where possible ([#619](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/619), [#756](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/756))
- Properly preserve `atime` for `copy*` with `preserveTimestamps` option ([#633](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/633))

**The following changes, allthough technically breaking, will not affect the vast majority of users:**

- `outputJson` now outputs objects as they were when the function was called, even if they are mutated later ([#702](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/702), [#768](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/768))

5.0.0 / 2017-12-11
------------------

Significant refactor of `copy()` & `copySync()`, including breaking changes. No changes to other functions in this release.

Huge thanks to **[@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou)** for doing most of the work on this release.

- The `filter` option can no longer be a RegExp (must be a function). This was deprecated since fs-extra v1.0.0. [#512](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/512)
- `copy()`'s `filter` option can now be a function that returns a Promise. [#518](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/518)
- `copy()` & `copySync()` now use `fs.copyFile()`/`fs.copyFileSync()` in environments that support it (currently Node 8.5.0+). Older Node versions still get the old implementation. [#505](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/505)
- Don't allow copying a directory into itself. [#83](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/83)
- Handle copying between identical files. [#198](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/198)
- Error out when copying an empty folder to a path that already exists. [#464](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/464)
- Don't create `dest`'s parent if the `filter` function aborts the `copy()` operation. [#517](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/517)
- Fix `writeStream` not being closed if there was an error in `copy()`. [#516](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/516)

4.0.3 / 2017-12-05
------------------

- Fix wrong `chmod` values in `fs.remove()` [#501](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/501)
- Fix `TypeError` on systems that don't have some `fs` operations like `lchown` [#520](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/520)

4.0.2 / 2017-09-12
------------------

- Added `EOL` option to `writeJson*` & `outputJson*` (via upgrade to jsonfile v4)
- Added promise support to [`fs.copyFile()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_copyfile_src_dest_flags_callback) in Node 8.5+
- Added `.js` extension to `main` field in `package.json` for better tooling compatibility. [#485](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/485)

4.0.1 / 2017-07-31
------------------

### Fixed

- Previously, `ensureFile()` & `ensureFileSync()` would do nothing if the path was a directory. Now, they error out for consistency with `ensureDir()`. [#465](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/465), [#466](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/466), [#470](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/470)

4.0.0 / 2017-07-14
------------------

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** The promisified versions of `fs.read()` & `fs.write()` now return objects. See [the docs](docs/fs-read-write.md) for details. [#436](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/436), [#449](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/449)
- `fs.move()` now errors out when destination is a subdirectory of source. [#458](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/458)
- Applied upstream fixes from `rimraf` to `fs.remove()` & `fs.removeSync()`. [#459](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/459)

### Fixed

- Got `fs.outputJSONSync()` working again; it was broken due to refactoring. [#428](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/428)

Also clarified the docs in a few places.

3.0.1 / 2017-05-04
------------------

- Fix bug in `move()` & `moveSync()` when source and destination are the same, and source does not exist. [#415](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/415)

3.0.0 / 2017-04-27
------------------

### Added

- **BREAKING:** Added Promise support. All asynchronous native fs methods and fs-extra methods now return a promise if the callback is not passed. [#403](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/403)
- `pathExists()`, a replacement for the deprecated `fs.exists`. `pathExists` has a normal error-first callback signature. Also added `pathExistsSync`, an alias to `fs.existsSync`, for completeness. [#406](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/406)

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** Removed support for setting the default spaces for `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()`. This was undocumented. [#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)

### Changed

- Upgraded jsonfile dependency to v3.0.0:
  - **BREAKING:** Changed behavior of `throws` option for `readJsonSync()`; now does not throw filesystem errors when `throws` is `false`.
- **BREAKING:** `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()` now output minified JSON by default for consistency with `JSON.stringify()`; set the `spaces` option to `2` to override this new behavior. [#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)
- Use `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` instead of `new Buffer()` in environments that support it. [#394](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/394)

### Fixed

- `removeSync()` silently failed on Windows in some cases. Now throws an `EBUSY` error. [#408](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/408)

2.1.2 / 2017-03-16
------------------

### Fixed

- Weird windows bug that resulted in `ensureDir()`'s callback being called twice in some cases. This bug may have also affected `remove()`. See [#392](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/392), [#393](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/393)

2.1.1 / 2017-03-15
------------------

### Fixed

- Reverted [`5597bd`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/5597bd5b67f7d060f5f5bf26e9635be48330f5d7), this broke compatibility with Node.js versions v4+ but less than `v4.5.0`.
- Remove `Buffer.alloc()` usage in `moveSync()`.

2.1.0 / 2017-03-15
------------------
